<h1>LP Score v4 — Validation & Stress-Test</h1>
<p><strong>Dataset:</strong> 44975 wallets, 396 columns (raw) • Generated on 2025-08-22 17:36:34</p>

<h2>Executive Summary (Top 10)</h2>
<ol>
<li>Aggregated score equals the sum of per-pool total_score for 40.6% of wallets; elsewhere an attenuation or normalization applies (mean delta agg−sum = -89.55, min -4069.12, max 122.25).</li><li>Category breakdown sum matches aggregated score for 40.6% of wallets; correlation is strong (r = 0.833) but not identity, implying category fields are partials with post-processing.</li><li>Per-pool component arithmetic is exact: score_breakdown.total_score equals the sum of its components for all slots checked (0 mismatches across all pools).</li><li>Deposit volume has weak association with aggregated score (r = 0.034); 22.1% of top-decile depositors have below-median aggregated scores.</li><li>Liquidity percent remaining is a major driver: wallets with ≥80% remaining have median aggregated score 512.00 vs 267.75 for ≤20%.</li><li>Dust behavior is penalized: highest decile of dust deposit counts has median aggregated score 246.04 vs 310.00 in the lowest.</li><li>Time factor works as expected: time_score decreases with staleness (corr days since last tx vs time_score = -0.217).</li><li>Volatility score shows weak/flat relation to lp_volatility_stddev (corr = -0.022); many bins plateau at ~150, suggesting caps or coarse bucketing.</li><li>Component attribution (top pool per wallet): liquidity_retention_score and time_score dominate proportional contributions; deposit_volume_score contributes less on average.</li><li>Detected 0 wallet–pool duplicate combinations and 31999 negative metric cells; anomalies CSV contains 562999 rows.</li>

<h2>Anomalies & Outliers</h2>
<p>See <code>anomalies.csv</code> for full list. Examples include: high deposits with high retention but below-median score; low deposits with top-decile score; stale activity with high time_score; duplicates; negative values; empty token symbols.</p>

<h2>Plausible Aggregation Formula</h2>
<p>Linear fit on all wallets yields α ≈ <strong>0.361</strong> and β ≈ <strong>161.43</strong> with R² ≈ <strong>0.403</strong>, indicating a downscaled sum plus offset model with additional caps/bucketization.</p>
<p>The evidence suggests aggregated_lp_score is approximately a <em>nonlinear transform</em> of the sum of per-pool total_score with <em>downward attenuation</em> when wallets hold many pools or extreme component values. A simple linear sum explains only ~40.6% exactly, while the remainder are mostly lower than the sum (mean delta −89.6). Category fields are <em>partials</em> that correlate (r≈0.83) and often sum to the aggregated score, but diverge after a normalization step.</p>
